    "A transit occurs when a planet passes between a star and its observer. Transits reveal an exoplanet not because we directly see it from many light-years away, but because the planet passing in front of its star ever so slightly dims its light. This dimming can be seen in light curves â€“ graphs showing light received over a period of time. When the exoplanet passes in front of the star, the light curve will show a dip in brightness. A light-curve is a plot of flux vs time, which is the type of plot we will be making today. \n",

Including, but not limited to, transient events such as supernovae or gamma ray bursts, periodic variations such as eclipsing binary stars or radio pulsars, and they can be used to detect aperiodic variations too such as blackholes with bright accretion disks.
