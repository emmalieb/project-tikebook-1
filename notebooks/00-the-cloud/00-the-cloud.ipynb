    "TIKE stands for the *Timeseries Integrated Knowledge Engine*.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIKE uses a web-based platform, called JupyterHub, to allow you to run [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and other software \"on the cloud\" using your web browser: no need to install anything on your local computer. TIKE has access to a cloud copy of the [MAST Archive](https://archive.stsci.edu), enabling researchers (or students!) to access and analyze data from NASA's [TESS mission](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess). \n",
    "\n",
    "TIKE is continually maintained and updated by humans, so if you run into issues please let us know. Don't hesitate to send us your suggestions for packages and tutorials, either through the [MAST help desk](mailto:archive@stsci.edu) or [Project TIKEBook repository](https://github.com/spacetelescope/tike_content)."

    "## What is the \"cloud\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"cloud\" is a term used to describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single data ecosystem. In other words, the cloud refers to servers that are accessed over the internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, TIKE is a cloud service that runs \"in proximity to\" MAST data. In practice, this means that the data is not transmitted over the internet, but rather within a data center. This leads to faster access since you don't need to perform a traditional download to move the data to your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would I want to work on the cloud?\n",
    "Using the cloud has several benefits; principally, as mentioned above, there's no need to download data to your local machine. This saves time, and allows you to perform analyses that wouldn't be possible without a major upgrade to your hard drive capacity. You can access data whenever and wherever you want to, from any device, as long as you have an internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the difference between working on the cloud and working on TIKE?\n",
    "Although you might choose to work directly with data stored on the cloud, it can be complex to configure such a system. TIKE handles this complexity, making it as easy as opening a Jupyter Notebook."
